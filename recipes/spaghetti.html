    <h2><strong>Description:</strong>></h2>
    <p>This classic Italian dish is as simple as it gets, but don't be fooled by its minimalist nature! Thinly sliced garlic and a kick of red pepper flakes dance together in a pan with fragrant olive oil, creating a tantalizing aroma that will have your taste buds doing the mambo. Toss this flavorful sauce with al dente spaghetti, sprinkle with fresh parsley, and voila! You've got a plate of pasta that will make you say "Holy cannoli, that's delicious!"</p>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces (225 grams) spaghetti</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust according to your spice preference)</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Steps:</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water according to the package instructions until al dente.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic slices and red pepper flakes to the skillet.</li>
        <li>Cook the garlic and pepper flakes, stirring frequently, until the garlic turns golden brown and fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from heat and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain it, reserving about 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water.</li>
        <li>Add the drained spaghetti to the skillet with the garlic and oil mixture.</li>
        <li>Toss the spaghetti with the garlic and oil, coating it evenly. If the pasta seems dry, add a splash of the reserved pasta cooking water to moisten it.</li>
        <li>Season the spaghetti with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Toss again to combine.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chopped parsley.</li>
        <li>Serve the spaghetti aglio e olio immediately, garnished with grated Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
